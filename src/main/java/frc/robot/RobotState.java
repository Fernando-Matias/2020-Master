/**
 * RobotState keeps track of the poses of various coordinate frames throughout
 * the match. A coordinate frame is simply a point and direction in space that
 * defines an (x,y) coordinate system. Transforms (or poses) keep track of the
 * spatial relationship between different frames.
 * 
 * Robot frames of interest (from parent to child):
 * 
 * 1. Field frame: origin is where the robot is turned on
 * 
 * 2. Vehicle frame: origin is the center of the robot wheelbase, facing
 * forwards
 * 
 * 3. Turret fixed frame: origin is the center of the turret when the turret is
 * at 0 degrees rotation relative to the vehicle frame
 * 
 * 4. Turret rotating frame: origin is the center of the turret as it rotates
 * 
 * 5. Camera frame: origin is the center of the camera imager as it rotates with
 * the turret
 * 
 * 6. Goal frame: origin is the center of the goal (note that orientation in
 * this frame is arbitrary). Also note that there can be multiple goal frames.
 * 
 * As a kinematic chain with 6 frames, there are 5 transforms of interest:
 * 
 * 1. Field-to-vehicle: This is tracked over time by integrating encoder and
 * gyro measurements. It will inevitably drift, but is usually accurate over
 * short time periods.
 * 
 * 2. Vehicle-to-turret-fixed: This is a constant.
 * 
 * 3. Vehicle-to-turret-rotating: This is a pure rotation, and is tracked over
 * time using the turret encoder.
 * 
 * 4. Turret-rotating-to-camera: This is a constant.
 * 
 * 5. Camera-to-goal: This is a pure translation, and is measured by the vision
 * system.
